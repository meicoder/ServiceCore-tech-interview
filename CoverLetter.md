# Cover Letter

Hi there,

I am excited to submit my application for the Fullstack Engineer (front-end oriented) position at Service Core. I have chosen to include a calculator code sample as part of my application.

The reason behind this choice is twofold. Firstly, a calculator is a fundamental software application that showcases the ability to implement basic arithmetic operations, error handling, and user interface design. It demonstrates my understanding of these core concepts.

Secondly, despite its simplicity, a calculator can be extended in numerous ways to include more complex operations such as handling parentheses, implementing scientific functions, and more. This shows my ability to write scalable and extensible code.

I believe this code sample, although simple, effectively demonstrates my technical skills and my approach to software development. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application further.

Best regards,

Marcos Espinoza
